# [WEkreta](https://hashiras-mercor.geetika1210.repl.co/)
## Track: Fullstack
WEkreta is aimed to solve the problems of the street vendors by becoming a platform providing the ailment to all their daily problems.

Ranging from converting their hardwork into smartwork to providing the feel of being working in an organised way are some of the benefits at the part of vendors to use us. Customers on the other hand get the power of bargaining back in their hands with a sense of added security and community building.

### For Vendors:
- They get the probabilities so that they can increase their revenue.
- They don't need to update their cart with items, just click the photo and the items on their vending cart will be updated to the dashboard by using image processing.
- They can get direct orders from customers.
- Higher the rating of vendor on our platform(calculated by reviews provided by customers, he gets a discount on the next month subscription+better visibility on our platform+other merits.

### For Consumers:
- Free Version: The app will also notify them if a verified vendor from our end enters their locality and shows names of various vendors near to the
consumer at the moment.
- Paid Version: Gives the consumer additonal features like the ability to track the exact location of nearby vendors, and direct conversation with them over our platform




## Tech Stack:
- MERN with Typescript and Next.js
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Flask
- NLP by CO:HERE API
- Puppeter

## Proposed Technical Features:
### For Consumer:
- Post sign up , platform asks them some question, through which ml model recognises their probable frequency of buying vegetables.
- Whenever user gives a review algorithm is feed for a transaction.
-  For every review that is provided, some credit points are added in consumerâ€™s account that can be used to redeem coupons in future

### For Vendor:
- AI is used to detect items on their cart and automatically update on the dashboard.
- Based on the review provided by customers, vendors are rated using nlp protocols on the platform.
- In accordance to the algorithm, prediction is made that at what location will the need of the product be maximum.


## Differentiating/X Factor:
The present developments/apps only either supply items/services from seller/warehouse to customer or provide the customer with the location to buy/avail from which forces them to guarantee the product quality and manage large warehousing and encounter logistics problems.

But, We are creating a separate vertical where the ones who go to customers(specifically street vendors) are getting tech enabled to increase their profits and we function just as an aggregator providing some service.
