- Based on the review provided by customers, vendors are rated using nlp protocols on the platform.

## Differentiating/X Factor:
The present developments/apps only either supply items/services from seller/warehouse to customer or provide the customer with the location to buy/avail from which forces them to guarantee the product quality and manage large warehousing and encounter logistics problems.

But, We are creating a separate vertical where the ones who go to customers(specifically street vendors) are getting tech enabled to increase their profits and we function just as an aggregator providing some service.
